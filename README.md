   Ensure your `build.gradle` file in the Android project matches the specified SDK versions:
   ```gradle
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           targetSdkVersion 34

   Before running the app, set up and deploy the mobile service backend. You can refer to the example in the provided service repository.

4. **Deploy the Service**:
   Follow the deployment instructions provided in the backend service repository to get your service up and running.

5. **Update Base URL**:
